#	location	

A __location__ is a vertex that is associated with a specific location along a link. Locations may be used to represent places where activities occur (e.g., driveways and bus stops). Its attributes are nearly the same as those for a node, except that the location includes an associated link and node, with location specified as distance along the link from the node. The Zone field enables the network to be loaded via locations (similar to what is done in TRANSIMS).

Ad hoc fields (e.g., area, subarea) may also be added.

Note on lr: If link geometry exists, it is used; otherwise the link geometry is assumed to be the straight line distance between the from_node and to_node

If x_coord or y_coord are not provided, they are derived from Link Ref\_Node and LR. If x_coord or y_coord are provided, Link Ref\_Node and LR are still required to place the location in the network.
