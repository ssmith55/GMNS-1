# link

A **link** is an edge in a network, defined by the
nodes it travels from and to. It may have associated geometry information. Links have three
types of attributes:

  - Those that define the physical location of the link (e.g., shape information, length,
    width)

  - Those that define the link’s directionality: from\_node, to\_node

  - Those that define properties in the direction of travel: capacity,
    free flow speed, number of lanes, permitted uses, grade, facility type

Link_ID is simply a unique primary key.  It might be an integer, sharedstreets reference id, or even a text string. 

Ad hoc fields may also be added. Examples might include jam density, wave speed, traffic message channel (TMC) identifier, traffic count sensor identifier and location, average daily traffic, etc. 

Note on the _lanes_ field: This field is maintained for compatibility with static models, where
    the Lanes table is not used. Here, it is treated as the number of
    permanent lanes (not including turn pockets) open to motor vehicles.  It does not include bike lanes, shoulders or parking lanes.
    Therefore, a link which acts solely as a contra-flow bike lane will
    have a number of lanes = 0.
